X ONE BIG VACATION plot histogram

X only wbetl has timers for validation, put timer into every tinystm mode

X Look at how validation time is gathered.
  You are only getting it when validation completes with no problems.
  When it fails you dont touch it.


GEN ASSEMBLY CHAPTER ON opencl executions


X add percentage labels to gnuplot bars, for example, percentage of time validatio runs. easier to compare between modes


start reading through NOREC validation


start with a lot of data, yada yada+ yada++, kmeans kmeans ++ etc
then say that from now on you will simplify observations recurring to a geometric
mean to represent entire program executions.
from now on kmeans kmeans+ kmeans++ -> just KMEANS



TODO add detailed validation, succ/fail graph
